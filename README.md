## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify cybersecurity incidents into specific types, addressing class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE, and deploy the solution through a Streamlit app for real-time, accessible incident prediction and response support.  

## Dataset 

Contains features like source and destination IPs, protocols, timestamps, and other network attributes capturing incident patterns. <br>
Target: incident_category, with labels such as malware, phishing, and network attacks.

## Business Use Case
 Enhances SOC efficiency by enabling quick incident classification, uncovering attack trends for threat intelligence, and generating real-time automated reports.



##  Approach

### Data Preparation & Exploration

Performed thorough data cleaning to handle missing and inconsistent values, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover incident trends, attack patterns, and feature correlations through visualizations.

### Data Balancing

Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and SMOTE-ENN, improving minority class representation and removing noise. Post-balancing, model accuracy improved from 0.60 to 0.68, and F1-scores across classes became more consistent.

### Feature Engineering

Selected key attributes such as `source_IP`, `destination_IP`, `protocol`, `timestamp`, and `severity`, and encoded categorical data for model compatibility.

### Model Training & Evaluation

Tested multiple algorithms ‚Äî Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and LightGBM ‚Äî evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and macro-F1 score.

* üèÜ Best Model: Random Forest
* Accuracy: 0.70‚ÄÉMacro-F1: 0.67‚ÄÉPrecision: 0.70‚ÄÉRecall: 0.66

### Deployment

Deployed the final Random Forest model using Streamlit, enabling real-time incident classification via an intuitive, web-based interface for SOC teams.

### Results Summary

| Model               | Macro-F1 | Precision | Recall |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
| Random Forest       | 0.84     | 0.82      | 0.81   |
| SVM                 | 0.81     | 0.79      | 0.77   |
| Logistic Regression | 0.76     | 0.75      | 0.74   |
